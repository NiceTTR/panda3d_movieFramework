# Stupid little Panda3d Animation Framework
This is some dumb little thing to ease me into using Panda3D for animations and the like.
To keep things simple I decided to use this with the TTO source rather than making things unusually complicated.

## How the heck do I use this?
Put this in the root directory of your Toontown source of choice.
It's only been tested on Open Toontown as of now, but it SHOULD work for TTR, TTI, TTS, TTH, or really any
traditional Toontown source. If it doesn't, let me know.

When you've done that, run it in Geany using the appropriate version of Panda3D for said source.
It should work if done correctly.
